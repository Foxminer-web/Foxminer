Introduction

Welcome to FOXMINER, the world’s first frontend CPU miner built from scratch for Monero (XMR) mining on Mac ARM64 systems (M1/M2). Launched in 2025 after 18 months of relentless optimization, FOXMINER redefines CPU mining by stripping away the complexity of traditional setups—no pool configs, no command-line tinkering, just a sleek app that maximizes your profits. Powered by RandomX with auto-algo switching via MoneroOcean integration, we’re here to squeeze every ounce of hashrate from your CPU while keeping resource usage low. Currently rocking ARM64 Macs, with Intel Mac support live and Windows/Linux versions dropping by Q4 2025—this is Monero mining, reborn.

Getting Started

Getting up and running with FOXMINER is a breeze. Download the DMG from our Installers page (coming soon), install it, and launch the app. Sign up with your email, paste your Monero wallet address (44-88 characters, starting with 4 or 8), hit “Save,” and click “Start Mining.” That’s it—your CPU’s now churning out XMR. No account yet? You’ll need one to track your stats on the dashboard, but the app’s free and open to all Mac users (ARM64 or Intel). Check the Dashboard page after signing in to monitor your hashrate, shares, and earnings in real time.

How It Works

FOXMINER is a native macOS app that runs locally on your CPU—no browser nonsense here. It taps into Monero’s RandomX algorithm, fine-tuned with auto-algo switching through MoneroOcean’s pool, dynamically adapting to network conditions for up to 20-30% higher profits than static miners. Once launched, it runs quietly in the background, even if you close the window—stopping only when you hit “Stop” or reboot. Optimized for ARM64 (M1/M2 chips), it delivers 1-3 kH/s on high-end Macs (think MacBook Pro 16” M2 Max) and 500-1500 H/s on Intel models, all while sipping RAM (under 200 MB) and keeping CPU load balanced. Future Windows/Linux builds will bring the same power to every rig by Q4 2025.

Features

Auto Algo-Switching: RandomX adapts on the fly via MoneroOcean, targeting the most profitable algos for your CPU.

ARM64 Optimization: Built for M1/M2 Macs—max hashrate, minimal strain (Intel Macs supported too).

Dashboard Insights: Live hashrate, worker stats, and payout tracking—signup unlocks it all.

Background Mining: Runs silently even when minimized—pause or stop anytime.

Multi-Platform Future: Windows and Linux versions coming Q4 2025—same app, broader reach.

Technical Details

FOXMINER’s core is an open-source RandomX engine, compiled natively for macOS ARM64 and Intel, hitting 1-3 kH/s on M1/M2 (e.g., 2.5 kH/s on M2 Max, 16 cores) and 0.5-1.5 kH/s on Intel i7/i9 rigs. It connects to MoneroOcean’s pool—payouts kick in at 0.3 XMR (configurable), with a tiny 0.003 XMR pool fee. Our dev fee’s a flat 5% (3% to FOXMINER, 2% to the original coder), way leaner than the 20-30% you’d see elsewhere. Expect 1 XMR per 20-40 MH of shares (difficulty ~120G, 1% orphan rate)—your Mac’s earning potential depends on cores and clock speed. All payouts land in your wallet automatically via MoneroOcean.

FAQ

Q: Do I need an account? Yes—to use the app and track stats. Sign up free on the site.

Q: What’s the payout threshold? 0.3 XMR default via MoneroOcean—adjustable in their system.

Q: Will it work on my Intel Mac? Yep—full support for older models, just lower hashrates.

Q: What about Windows/Linux? Coming Q4 2025—ARM64 Macs are the priority now.

Q: Fees? 5% dev fee (3% us, 2% coder) + 0.003 XMR pool fee—keeps us lean and mean.

Troubleshooting

Mining won’t start? Double-check your wallet address—44-88 chars, starts with 4 or 8. Re-enter and save.

Low hashrate? Older Macs or fewer cores limit output—test on a beefy M1/M2 for peak results.

App crashing? Ensure macOS is updated (14.0+ recommended). Restart and reinstall if needed.

Dashboard empty? Sign in first—stats sync with your account, not the app alone.
