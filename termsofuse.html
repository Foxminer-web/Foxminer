        <h2>2. Service Overview</h2>
        <p>Foxminer is a free-to-use cryptocurrency mining application designed to mine Monero (XMR) using your device’s CPU. Available initially for macOS ARM64, with support for Intel x86_64, Windows, and Linux coming in Q4 2025, the App connects to the MoneroOcean mining pool. Installation and use are free, subject to the fee structure outlined below.</p>

        <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use Foxminer. By using the App, you represent that you meet this age requirement and that your use complies with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

        <h2>4. Fees and Costs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free to Use</strong>: Foxminer is free to download, install, and operate—no upfront costs or subscription fees apply.</li>
            <li><strong>5% Developer Fee</strong>: To support server maintenance and ongoing development, 5% of your mined hashrate is directed to the Foxminer team. This is split as 3% to the Foxminer wallet and 2% to the original open-source CPU mining script creator, honoring their foundational work.</li>
            <li><strong>0.003 XMR Pool Fee</strong>: When cashing out rewards via MoneroOcean, a 0.003 XMR pool fee applies per transaction, leveraging their auto-algo switching for optimal rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>User Responsibility</strong>: You are responsible for any electricity, hardware, or internet costs incurred while mining.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide a valid XMR wallet address for payouts.</li>
            <li>Ensure your device meets minimum requirements (e.g., macOS ARM64 for initial release).</li>
            <li>Comply with local laws regarding cryptocurrency mining.</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to modify, reverse-engineer, or misuse the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Foxminer, including its logo, design, and code, is owned by the Foxminer team or its licensors. You are granted a non-exclusive, revocable license to use the App for personal mining purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Guarantees</strong>: We do not guarantee specific mining rewards, uptime, or profitability, as these depend on external factors (e.g., network difficulty, hardware performance).</li>
            <li><strong>Risk</strong>: Mining involves risks, including hardware wear and energy costs—you use Foxminer at your own risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Third Parties</strong>: We are not liable for issues with MoneroOcean or your wallet provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
